Series: Arcane

Opinion: As DOTA player I was not really looking forward to seeing this, but so many of my friends did recommend this to me that I just could not see it.
Story is very catching and you don't need to know anything about LoL to understand what is going on.
Animations are gorgeous, music is unbelievably fitting and I have to admit most of the songs in this series now resides in my personal playlists.

Series: South Park

Opinion: Ridiculous and absurd at times; never fails to provide surprisingly accurate social commentary. Must see for any fan of TV entertainment.

Series: Bojack Horseman		
					
Opinion: Best depresing thing to watch. Even though it is cartoonish, it brings surprising topics to describe, such as alcoholism, selfhate, suicide,
drug use, child abuse etc.
